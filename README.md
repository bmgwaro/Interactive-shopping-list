# Interactive Shopping List

## Description

The following is a simple web application aimed at designing an interactive shopping list. The main purpose of the challenge is to make use of DOM manipulation, array iteration and event handling techniques.

## Prerequisites

Array: Maintain a JavaScript array to store shopping list items.

DOM Manipulation:

- Create an HTML structure with an input field for adding items, a list container to display items, and buttons for "Add", "Mark Purchased", and "Clear List".
- Use JavaScript to dynamically add new items to the list container when the user clicks the "Add" button. (The new items do not have to be persisted once the page refreshes)
- Update the list item visually to indicate purchased items (e.g., strikethrough text, different background color).

Event Handling:

- Attach event listeners to the "Add" button to capture user input and add items to the list.
- Attach event listeners to the list of items to allow users to mark them as purchased.
- Attach an event listener to the "Clear List" button to remove all items from the list.

## Requirements

- Node environment
- 2GB free disc space
- 2GB RAM
- Operating system
- Text editor
- Browser console

## Getting started

1. Click fork in the github repository located in the following link;

[https://github.com/bmgwaro/Interactive-shopping-list]

2. Open your terminal.
3. Use the "cd" command to navigate into the directory where you would like to save the fork.
4. Use git clone to clone the repository into your local environment. Feel free to copy paste this into your terminal;

`git clone git@github.com:bmgwaro/Interactive-shopping-list.git`

5. Now, navigate into the same directroy and type in the command "code ." in your terminal to open the files on your text editor.
6. You can use the live-server extension on VScode to open the files in your preferred browser.

## Using the application

Once the application is open in your browser, you will see an input field where you are required to type in the items for your shopping list one at a time.
After typing in the input, you can use either one of the three buttons to interact with the application as you please.

_NB: This application has three main features;_

- An "add" button that allows you to add your item to the shopping list.

- A "mark purchased" button which allows the user to mark all items in the list as purchased. Purchased items should have a green background color.

**Note that you can also click on each one of the items in the list in order to independently mark the clicked item as already purchased**

- A "clear list" button that allows the user to delete all the items from their shopping list after they are done with their shopping.

_Once you click on the clear list button, you would have to refresh the page in order to use the application to make a new shopping list_
